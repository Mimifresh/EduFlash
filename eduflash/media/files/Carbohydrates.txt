Functions of Carbohydrates
1. Carbohydrates are the main sources of energy in 
the body. Brain cells and RBCs are almost wholly 
dependent on carbohydrates as the energy source. 
Energy production from carbohydrates will be 4 
kcal/g.
2. Storage form of energy (starch and glycogen).
3. Excess carbohydrate is converted to fat.
4. Glycoproteins and glycolipids are components of cell 
membranes and receptors.
5. Structural basis of many organisms: Cellulose of 
plants; exoskeleton of insects, cell wall of microorganisms, mucopolysaccharides as ground substance 
in higher organisms.
 The general molecular formula of carbohydrate is 
Cn
(H2
O)n
. For example, glucose has the molecular 
formula C6H12O6. Carbohydrates are polyhydroxy 
aldehydes or ketones or compounds which yield 
these on hydrolysis (Fig. 6.1).
NOMENCLATURE
Molecules having only one actual or potential sugar 
group are called monosaccharides (Greek, mono = one; 
saccharide = sugar). They cannot be further hydrolyzed 
into smaller units. When two monosaccharides are 
combined together with elimination of a water molecule, 
it is called a disaccharide (e.g. C12H22O11). Trisaccharides 
contain three sugar groups. Further addition of sugar 
groups will correspondingly produce tetrasaccharides, 
pentasaccharides and so on, commonly known as 
oligosaccharides (Greek, oligo = a few). When more than 10 sugar units are combined, they are generally named as 
polysaccharides (Greek, poly = many). Polysaccharides 
having only one type of monosaccharide units are called 
homopolysaccharides and those having different 
monosaccharide units are heteropolysaccharides.
Sugars having aldehyde group are called aldoses
and sugars with keto group are ketoses. Depending on 
the number of carbon atoms, the monosaccharides are 
named as triose (C3), tetrose (C4), pentose (C5), hexose 
(C6), heptose (C7) and so on. Commonly occurring 
monosaccharides are given in Table 6.1.
